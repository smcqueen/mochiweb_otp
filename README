This project contains mochiweb_otp and mochiweb itself. Mochiweb is essentially untouched with the exception of an added .app file to bring it into OTP compliance.

Stan McQueen: I have replaced the actual lib/mochiweb/ directory with a link to /projects/mochiweb/. That way, I can update mochiweb from source with less effort.
